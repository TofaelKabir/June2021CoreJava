/*
 1) Conditional Statements allow the program to behave differently based on condition. Example: if, else, else if, Switch.
2) != is called ‘not equal to’
3) == is called ‘equality operator’
4) % is called ‘Modulus or remainder’. FYI: If we divide 9 with 2, then 9 is called ‘Dividend’, 2 is called ‘Divisor’, 4 is called ‘quotient’ and 1 is called ‘Remainder/modulus’
5) && is called ‘logical and operator’
6) || is called ‘logical or operator’ (the symbol is called pipe)
7) Regarding condition: First condition is if
8) Generally we don't use 2 if condition (codewise ok), rather we use if as first condition and else or else if as second condition. 
9) Generally the true statement is written at the end.
10) When we write else, no condition is necessary to write as parentheses.
11) But if we wish to write a second condition , we have to use ‘else if’, not ‘else’.
