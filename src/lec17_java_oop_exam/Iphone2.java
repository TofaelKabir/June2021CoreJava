 06) NOW, Iphone1 came in 2000, but the new model Iphone2, Iphone3 came in 2001. Assume Iphone1 is a superclass and Iphone2, Iphone3 is the child class of the Iphone1. in 2002, Iphone4 come into the market which inherits Iphone2. in 2003, Iphone5 come into the market which inherits Iphone4. In 2004, Iphone6 come into the market which inherits Iphone5. Consider all of them as a regular class and write a method inside them related to one of the features like ---- map (use in Iphone3 and print out "Map is introduce in Iphone3. The price is increased to 780$"), youtube, dropbox, photos, email, compass, etc (6 methods for 6 class). What kind of concept you can use to relate to them? Instantiate Iphone6 and show how many methods they can call in TestPhone. [points: 30] .

 07) Again, from Iphone1, we got 4 private variables we know. Create 2 constructors inside it using that 4 private variables -- default and parameterized after those variables. In IPhone2, declare a char variable userOfIphone2 (M or F). create default and parameterized constructor, a void type method iPhone2Info, a parameterized method with same name iPhone2Info inside Iphone2 class. Use the super method and super keyword in constructor, and super keyword in methods of Iphone2. Call constructor and methods. Can you call variable by super keyword? create a public variable inside Iphone1 and execute it in Iphone2. Execute all of them in TestPhone. [points: 30]
